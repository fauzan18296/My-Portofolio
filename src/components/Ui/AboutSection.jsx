I am a high school graduate, I aspire to be <span className="text-indigo-400 font-semibold">a programmer</span> or <span className="text-indigo-400 font-semibold">developer</span>. I learned coding from grade 10 to grade 12 autodidactically and it has become part of my hobby. I have been learning coding for about 5-6 years, especially web coding. I am quite good at making user-friendly designs, and I also quite like things related to problem solving, especially problem solving in the form of program code. In addition, I always want to improve my abilities both in terms of hard skills and soft skills.</p>
